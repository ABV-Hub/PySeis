[Why SU?](https://github.com/stuliveshere/PySeis/blob/master/docs/notebooks/2.0%20The%20SU%20interface.ipynb)

So somewhere in this mess is a basic working seismic processing package.  To get an idea of how I see it working, check out the scripts in Projects/test/scripts.

I'm in the middle of some heavy refactor, so not much is working right now.

Dependencies
==========

[Intel Distribution for Python from Anaconda.](https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/using-intel-distribution-for-python-with-anaconda)

I'm still running python 2.7 for now, I aim to cut over to python 3 once i've confirmed support on the target PCs.
